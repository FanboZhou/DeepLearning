Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependenceof graphs via the message passing between the nodes of graphs. In this work, we propose to apply different graphneural networks such as RecGNNs and ConvGNNs for Image Word Recognition. We will compare the performanceof different GNN on popular Image data set like MNIST, SVHN, and ImageNet
